# Practicing-Selenium-TestNg-POM
Assignments 20 and 21 for homework on IT Bootcamp course

Testing webpage:https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com 

Assignment 20 (TestNG):

 - Test the signup page on the website https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com
Verify that the route "/signup" appears in the page url. Verify that the attribute type in the email input field has the value "email" and for password that it has the attribute type "password".
Check manually negative cases (invalid email, short password, unfilled data ...), and then create automatic tests for checking the error if it is displayed. Positive cases are not of interest to us here. It is desirable to have a minimum of 5 tests.
Use TestNG and add before and after class methods.

Assignment 21 (POM patterns):

 -  Do the same task as for Assignment20, however use the new patterns (POM) that we did in the lecture. It is necessary to create three separate projects and apply a different pattern in each one.
